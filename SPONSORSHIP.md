We welcome sponsorships that support the development and maintenance of the OpenBikeControl protocol and the exploration of potential future hardware. Sponsorships are voluntary contributions and are not payments for goods or services.

# Sponsor Options

You can sponsor the project via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/openbikecontrol). If you need a different arrangement, feel free to contact us.

## Sponsoring as an Organization

Your support helps ensure that OpenBikeControl remains open, transparent, and maintained. Sponsorships are contributions without commercial obligations on either side.

## Sponsoring as an Individual

Individual sponsorships are voluntary and do not establish a purchase, a pre-order, or a consumer contract. As a gesture of appreciation, I may provide discretionary acknowledgments. These are optional, not guaranteed, and have no monetary value assigned to them.

For contributions above approximately 10 EUR / USD, and strictly as a courtesy, I may provide:

- If you don't already have it: A promotional code for SwiftControl, subject to availability and not offered as part of a sale or transaction. Please contact us for this!

- A potential future discount code for OpenBikeControl hardware, but only if such hardware is eventually released. Hardware development is exploratory, without any confirmed release timeline or commitment that a product will be produced or sold.

Any acknowledgments are voluntary on our part, depend on availability, and do not create rights, expectations, or obligations. Sponsorships do not include the supply of digital content, physical goods, or services under EU consumer-contract rules.
