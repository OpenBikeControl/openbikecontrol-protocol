We welcome sponsorships that support the development and maintenance of the OpenBikeControl protocol and the exploration of potential future hardware. Sponsorships are voluntary contributions and are not payments for goods or services.

# Sponsor Options

You can sponsor the project via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/openbikecontrol). If you need a different arrangement, feel free to contact us.

## Sponsoring as an Organization

Your support helps ensure that OpenBikeControl remains open, transparent, and maintained. Sponsorships are contributions without commercial obligations on either side.

## Sponsoring as an Individual

Individual sponsorships are voluntary contributions. They do not constitute a purchase, pre-order, or consumer contract under EU law. The following wording is intentionally formal to clarify this.

As a friendly gesture, I may offer occasional acknowledgments to individual supporters. These are entirely discretionary, depend on availability, and are not provided in exchange for the sponsorship.

If OpenBikeControl hardware becomes available in the future, I may provide sponsors with an optional discount code. Hardware development is still exploratory, and there is no confirmed timeline or guarantee that a product will be released.

These acknowledgments do not create any rights or obligations. Sponsorships do not include the supply of digital content, physical goods, or services within the meaning of EU consumer-protection legislation.
